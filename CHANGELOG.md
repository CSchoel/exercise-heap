All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.2] - 2024-03-24

### Added

* New exercises in `exercises/2024/ChatGPT`.
* ChatGPT template in `notes`.
* Script to extract exercises from ChatGPT responses in `scripts/generation/chatgpt_extract.py`.

## [0.2.1] - 2023-01-29

### Updated

* Refactored `scripts/export/export_dozeloc.py` to use new Python API and allow selecting exercises by description language.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-01-28

### Added

* Import script that allows importing exercises into the repo without cloning it or running any scripts.
* Second variant of `suggest_tags` that uses a list of predefined tag candidates.
* Script to automatically translate exercise text into another (natural) language.
* Basic Python API tracked as Poetry project.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-01-06

### Added

* Script to check that each exercise description file includes a YAML header with a UUID that is truly unique in the database.
* GitHub Actions script that runs UUID-check after each push.
* Several new exercises that were not created for a specific course but just for fun (covering integer overflows, floating point operations, and bitwise operators)
* General file to collect exercise ideas

### Changed

* Versioning scheme: Added scripts and changes to general structure now increase MINOR version and updates that only affect exercise content increase PATCH version.

### Fixed

* `add_uuid` script did not recognize existing UUIDs properly (missing `M` flag for regex)
* AuD exercises did not have a UUID

## [0.0.4] - 2021-12-29

### Added

* Type aliases for more complex types such as `Index` and `IndexVector`
* Function `explain_similarity`, which returns the terms that had the most weight in calculating cosine similarity.
* Parameter `explain` in `find_similar`, which allows printing explanations for which terms determined the similarity.

### Changed

* Term frequency is now divided by total number of terms in order to make index independent of document length.
* Uses `log ((n+1) / count)` instead of `log ((n+1) / count)` in `idf` to avoid weights becoming zero for terms that appear in each document.
* Index is now a dictionary instead of a list of tuples.
* Use custom tokenization algorithm, which separates by spaces and then trims non-word characters from both ends of the token.
* Only apply stemming to words, which only consist of word characters and `-`.
* Removes keep_default from `dict_reduce` and introduces `dict_filter` instead.

### Fixed

* Applies `make_hashable` to tags to ensure that same tag names are used on both sides of comparison.
* Forgot to apply IDF weights to query vector.
