# Script ideas

* Check for exercises that do not have the following tag types:
  * `teaches`
  * `submission`
* Maybe `teaches` should imply `requires`?
* Remove plural-`s` from `requires: ...s`
* If there is a `alternative-1` folder in `sol`, copy all other files into `alternative-2`.
* Suggest tags to add/removed based on tags of other exercises instead of content.
* Collect meta-rules for tags that always/never go together?
* Use WordNet to search for tags that are synonymous with each other
