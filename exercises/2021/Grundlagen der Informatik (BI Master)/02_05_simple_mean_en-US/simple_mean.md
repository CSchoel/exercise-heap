# Simple Mean

This task is all about the mean. We want to calculate the average of the values of a list.
Unfortunately, we still live somewhat in the past and can't use built-in functions.
We're old-fashioned today and we do it by hand.
It is about determining the mean of all elements in the following list: `[500, 504, 499, 399, 590, 123, 430, 758, 938, 637, 750, 735]`
Please save the result in a variable called `result` in the file `smean.py` so that the test has it easier. :)
