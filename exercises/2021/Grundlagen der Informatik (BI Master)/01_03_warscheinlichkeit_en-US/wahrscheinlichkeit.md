# Probability

It's about a little crap game.
It's simple: the 6 wins.
One of the players wonders how likely it is to roll a 6 three times in a row and so he makes it his task.

Calculate the student's probability that he'll roll the six three times in a row.
Please indicate the probability in percent and round it to 2 digits after the comma.

Please save the result in a variable called `result` and call the source file `probability.py`.

*TIPP: This can be done with `round(value, decimals)`*
