# Hello World

The classic! Everyone knows it, no matter which programming language you start:

Hello World! We want to save this string in a variable.

In Python, this is super easy and fast, unlike other languages, we don't have to specify data types!

So create a variable with the name `hello` in a file `hello_world.py` and save in it: `"Hello World!"'

Notes: 
* Dozeloc always needs a `.py` file as a solution.
    You can select these with the "Browse.." button and then with "Check!" have it checked.
* The name of the variable is important for the test, please do not name it otherwise.
* The name of the `.py` file is also important so that Dozeloc can import it.
* If everything works correctly, you should see the following output on green background in the left text box:

    ```
