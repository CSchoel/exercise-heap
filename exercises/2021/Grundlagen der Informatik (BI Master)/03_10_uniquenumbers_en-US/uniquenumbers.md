# UniqueNumbers

Write a `uniqueNumbers(numbers: List[int]) -> Set[int]`, which takes a list of integers `numbers` and adds the numbers without duplicates to a set.

Save this function in a file named `uniquenumbers.py`.
You may use a maximum of two lines of code for this. Comments and imports are not counted.

> You can import type definitions (optional) with `from typing import List, Set`. Further imports are neither required nor allowed!
> Note: What are the special features of a set? Do you need to check for duplicates?
