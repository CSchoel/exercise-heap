# Percentages

The teacher of the course wants to prepare a nice potato gratin for his students.
Unfortunately, his course is very large and he needs a lot of potatoes.
Therefore, he buys a 25 kg sack of potatoes from the organic farmer around the corner.
Today the lecturer has luck there is 15 euros discount on the sack that would cost normal 56 euros.
So he wonders, how much of the basic price did he save?

The result of the calculation should be in a variable called `result`, the source file gets the name `percent.py`.
Then please round the result to two decimal places!

*TIPP: With `round(value, places behind the comma)` the value is rounded to the specified decimal places.*
