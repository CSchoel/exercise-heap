# Word Frequency Counter

Write a function `word_frequency(text: str) -> dict` in a file named `word_frequency.py`. The function should take a string `text` as input and return a dictionary where keys are words in the text, and values are the frequencies of those words in the text.

The function should be case-insensitive, meaning "Word" and "word" should be considered the same word.

Example:

```python
result = word_frequency("This is a test. This is only a test.")
print(result) # -> {'this': 2, 'is': 2, 'a': 2, 'test': 2, 'only': 1}
```

> Tip: You can use the `split()` method to split the text into words and `lower()` method to convert words to lowercase.
