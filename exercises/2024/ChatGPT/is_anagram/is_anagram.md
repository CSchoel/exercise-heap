# Anagram Checker

Create a function called `is_anagram(word1: str, word2: str) -> bool` in `anagram.py` that checks if two input strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. The function should return `True` if the two words are anagrams, and `False` otherwise.

Example:

```python
result = is_anagram("listen", "silent")
print(result)  # -> True

result = is_anagram("hello", "world")
print(result)  # -> False
```

> Hint: You can use Python's Counter class to count occurrences of characters in each word.

Make sure to save the function in a file called `anagram.py` so that it can be imported with `from anagram import is_anagram`.
