# Vowel Counter

Write a function `count_vowels(input: str) -> int` in `vowel_counter.py` that takes a string `input` and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the input string.

Example:

```python
result = count_vowels("hello")
print(result) # -> 2

result = count_vowels("python")
print(result) # -> 1
```

Make sure to save the function in a file called `vowel_counter.py` so that it can be imported with `from vowel_counter import count_vowels`.
